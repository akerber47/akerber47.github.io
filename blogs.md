# What's This?

Here's some online writing I think is non-toxic and worth reading. I'm always
behind on it but I try to print things out and catch up on them when I can.
(It's difficult to get through things deeply and avoid getting sidetracked when
I'm online.)

### Math
- Gowers?
- Terry Tao
- nLab
