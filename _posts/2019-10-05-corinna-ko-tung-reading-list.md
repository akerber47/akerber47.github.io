- Jane Austen, complete works beginning with *Pride and Prejudice*
- Edith Wharton, *The Custom of the Country*, *The Age of Innocence*, *The
  Buccaneers*, *The House of Mirth* (must be read in strict order -- you will
  understand why when you finish the last one)

- Evelyn Waugh, *Brideshead Revisited*
- Anthony Trollope, all the books in the Palliser series, beginning with

  you are ready to attempt some light Proust.

For future reference?
