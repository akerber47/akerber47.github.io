Textbook notes from Stanford 2019 Fall term

Statistics

200 Statistical inference
Rice

202 Data Mining
Hastie easy book

205 Nonparametric stats
Wasserman All of Nonparametric statistics
- good!

Lai/Xing (finance bok) is the profs own book ... questionable

300A Theoretical Stats (PhD)
Keener, Theoretical Statistics
- a bit fancier than Casella-Berger
- a lot more "modern" than the scary Lehmann books

310A Probability (PhD)
Billingsley
Durrett
another book
- for grad probability

160
Freedman et al, Statistics
- is the best intro statistics book I've seen!
- But  it is too easy for me, won't learn much
- try to find from library

191 Applied stats
Chaterjee + Hadi, Regression Analysis by Example
- very good! Undergrad level regression theory (like Shalzi)
- much less obnoxious/big than the Applied Linear Regression Models book
- buy/rent once I get to Shalizi

Stanford stat 160 = UG standard stats
(MIT 18.650 is in between)
- Stat 200 = Masters stats (Rice)
- Stat 191 = UG applied stats (Chaterjee -> like CMU Shalzi)
- Stat 202 = data mining Hastie
- Stat 205 = Non parametric stats (Wasserman)
- Stat 300 = Hard theoretical stats
(I think Keener will be easier than the Lehmann duology)

Business

Fancy finance:
- Campbell, Financiel Decisions and Markets
- Campbell + Vicera, Stragetic Asset Allocation
- these two really good!

Gulliver, Economics of Risk and Time

Physics

Fancy physics:
- Kardar, Statistical Physics of Fields
- resp also Statistical Physics of Particles

Arfbenetal, Mathematical Methods for Physics
- If I need an ungodly boring "lots of random applied math book",
this is probably it

Miller, Quantum Mechanics for Scientists and Engineers
- very applied/eng focus, solving actual problems! Interesting


Econ

Fancy/formal econ (all 1st year econ PhD level):
- Mas-Colell, Microeconomic Theory -- includes games, decisions, uncertainty,
markets, principal-agent, etc!
-> Jehle-Reny, Advanced Microeconomic Theory
-> Kreps, Microeconomic Foundations I

Findenberg-Troale, Game Theory
but Osborne-Rubinstein, A Couse in Game Theory is much shorter!

CS

Bunneau et al, Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies
-> lolz but probably as good as I'll get

otherwise, just Cormen et al, and instructors assigning their own books
(Kochenderfer might be worth looking at as a course)

Ge Wang, Artful Design
- great book on design! Cool!

Kochenderfer, Decision Making Under Uncertainty
- breezy business-major ish, director-certified treatment,
- read but don't buy
