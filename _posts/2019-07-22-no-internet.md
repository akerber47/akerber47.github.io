title: Internet: Just Say No
---

I really should stay off the internet. This probably doesn't need too much
elaboration, but it's just too difficult for me personally. Reasons include:
- I gravitate toward argumentative comment sections which always leave me
  drained and sad. When insults get delivered at general groups, I often take
  them personally myself. This has especially been a recent problem for me on
  Hacker News because of certain categories I belong to.
- I am too easily swayed by authoritative comments in written form. The more
  educated and civil the commenters are, the more difficult it is for me.
  I think I am easily convinced by written arguments all the time, especially
  when presented in "book-like language." This causes me to rapidly flip around
  my opinions without the time for deliberation that a book natuarlly provides.
  I have picked up all sorts of untrue facts and destructive ways of thinking
  over the last decade or so.
- The time I spend looking at things online cuts into my creative energy. It's
  hard to get bored. Boredom makes me try new things and think through
  complicated ideas. When I look things up online, I don't feel this need as
  heavily and so it's very slow for me to make progress on complicated personal
  projects.
- When I'm looking at "fun" things on the internet, it's difficult for me to
  pull away to pay attention to co-workers, family, friends, etc. This makes
  using a computer in any situation with others around trouble. I often miss
  things and upset people. My brain's not completely on the social activity so
  subtleties get lost (it's similar to having a conversation while driving).

With all that in mind, there are some good reasons to stay.
- Being informed gives me things to talk about with other informed people.
  - Counterpoint: both people in a conversation repeating things we read on the
    same websites is not much of a conversation. By spending time offline I'm
    more likely to find genuinely novel things to contribute.
- Using the internet is more fun (short-term) than sitting around being bored.
  - Counterpoint: I am rarely satisfied afterwards. Like watching too much TV
    or video, it leaves me feeling hollow and drained. Even as a kid I found
    non-internet things to do, and I should be able to do the same as an adult
    also.
- The internet helps me look things up faster during my personal life and while
  working on personal projects.
  - Counterpoint: Obviously, some internet use is essential. (Paying bills,
    communicating with friends and loved ones, etc). And I need to be able to
    handle things online and look things up quickly at work. But I don't
    particularly enjoy that shallow mode of working. (Quick google search, type
    in what I found, rinse and repeat...). I do it because I have to. I think
    that in the long term
