Some quick notes on basic undergrad microeconomics from a mathematical
perspective.

- Basic consumer and producer theory is all about constrained optimization,
  using basic calculus. (Lagrange multipliers, etc.)

- "marginal" means "local" -- ie, computed using derivatives and nearby
  infinitesimal behavior.

- Constraints are typically linear (budgets, etc). Functions to optimize
  are highly nonlinear. Choice of function to optimize depends on model.

- A surprising number of intuitive qualitative results (monopoly behavior,
  taxation effects, etc) fall out of these simple models.

- Quantitative results at this level are almost all trivial.

- To build more sophisticated models with incomplete information, multiple
  organized actors, adversarial competition, etc, either need to fall back on
  an "infinite-agent approximation" (perfect free market, perfect information,
  etc) or move into more advanced theory.

- Game theory becomes highly intertwined with these more advanced models.

- Using basic microeconomics to tackle large scale real problems (housing
  markets, labor markets, capital markets) leads to quick results but makes
  me very nervous.
