title: Queues
---

There is such a thing as queueing theory, but in CS there's nothing special
about a queue. Why hasn't anyone invented "stacking theory" or better yet
"treeing theory" or "graphing theory". I suspect there are just as many
processes (industrial or otherwise) where these apply.

Knuth may have something about this. I can't imagine anywhere else, but I'm no
expert.
