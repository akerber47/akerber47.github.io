Q: What knowledge/understanding/roadmap to get out of the bookstore?

I guess the question is what next? (after accouning + finance)
- ie what math and science skills will help me?

Misc fun/soft books

- Rona Forooker, Don't Be Evil
- Gregory Zuckerman, The Case Against Big Tech
- Daniel Markovits, The Meritocracy Trap

Programming ("Advanced") + SWE Skills

- Martin Fowler, Refactoring
- Kurt Galroth, Optimized C++
- Drew Neil, Practical Vim
- Keith J. Grant, CSS In Depth
- Paul Butcher, Seven Concurrency Models In Seven Weeks

Microsoft Excel books:

- Wayne Winston, Microsoft Excel: Data Analysis and Basic Modeling
- Conrad Carlberg, Statistical Analysis
- Conrad Carlberg, Predictive Analytics
- Albright + Fox, Mathematical Models in Excel
  - fancy models + pretty cool! (this is actually a legit math book)


Applied Math / Math-y CS

- Shalev-Schwartz-Ben-David, Understanding ML
- Mohri et al, Foundations of ML
  - These two are pretty much the same book!
  - (algorithmic/complexity approach to ML -- enough to read the real papers!)

Fun applications:
- Snyder + Qi, fundamentals of Computer Vision
- Lyon, Human and Machine Hearing
  - both these two feature real math (wow!)
- Jacob Eisenstein, Introduction to Natural Language Processing
  - not as cool

- Brunton + Kurtz, Data-Driven Science and Engineering
  - despite the bad title, this is a really good book on optmization from
    applied math perspective
  - control / dynamical systems / reinforcement
  - this is "hard version of":
- Kochendorfer-Wheeler, Algorithms for Optimization

- Easley + Kleinberg, Networks, Crowds and Markets
  - kind of soft, few easy exercises
  - but fun read on good modern ideas!

- Wainwright, High-Dimensional Statistics
  - read after: Durrett not really necessary
  - Bickel-Doksum or equivalent (eg that blue book from Stanford)
  - no need for high-dimensional probability

- Gelman + Hill, Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models
  - throw out Shalzi, use this instead.
  - (similar: applied regression, etc)

Math fun:

- Tu, Differential Geometry
  - From the Bott and Tu guy!
  - learn Riemannian manifolds properly
- Office Hours with a Geometric Group Theorist
  - 1/4 of "grad school nostalgia"
- Akiyama-Matsunaga, Treks Into Intuitive Geometry
  - this is "hard recreational math" (like Winning Ways)

Hard math with applications:

- Boissonnant et al, Geometric and Topological  Inference
  - basically "manifold learning for mathematicians" (from geometric perspective)

- Gautschi, Numerical Analysis
  - not that hard, but more mature/advanced than the UG texts I've seen
  - still assumes no analysis/topology/etc
  - no coverage of linear topics

- Audrei + Hare, Derivative-Free and Blackbox Optimization
  - aka "RL with math" (lots of it!)

- Lovasz, Graphs and Geometry
  - geometrically flavored, optimization algorithms on graphs

- Pablo Pedregal, Optimization and Approximation
  - a "quick taste"
  - dynamic programming, optimal control, and linear programming / convex opt.

- Beleguck + Chadrapatha, Optimization Concepts and Applications in Engineering
  - best overview from hard eng perspective!
  - many methods
  - complementary with Brunton-Katz which is "modern" (this book is "classical")

- Brzezido-Zatowniak, Basic Stochastic Processes
  - get this again!

Finance:

- Macros Lopez de Prado, Advances in Financial ML
  - BUY IT! RISE to the occasion!

- Cornuejols et al, Optimization Methods in Finance
  - classical as well: linear + quadratic programming, stochastics, dynamic programming

- Blyth, An Introduction to Quantitative Finance
  - same material as Hull in just 150 pages! Dense!
  - easier but similar: Sacari, Mathematics of Finance

- Severini, Introduction to Statistical Methods for Financial Models
  - basic portfolio theory with some stats, good "fill in" book

- Bouchard et al, Trades, Quotes, and Prices
  - possibly the only book ever about HFT and small scale market dynamics
  - "think like RenTech" -- maybe?

- Bichler, Market Design
  - interesting overview

Theory for finance:
- Chen, Stochastic Game Strategies and their Applications
- Oskdal-Salon, Applied Stochastic Control and Jump Diffusions
- Steele, Stochastic Calculus and Financial Applications
  - best book I've found on "real" (rigorous) QF math
  - Ito, stochastic PDE, etc
