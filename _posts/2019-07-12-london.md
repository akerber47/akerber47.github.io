title: Idle thoughts on a London trip
---

- Foyles is great. Why can't these exist in more places? Does Strand NYC sell
  technical / math books?

- SF Bay Area has the saddest seafood scene of any water-adjacent place I've
  ever been. And yet it's the place I live. How sad.

- It only takes a couple days to fill my conversations with "bill", "cheers",
  "university", "flatmate", "lift", and other such words.

- I think I've discovered a **secret formula** for beating jet lag:
  - Travel in the summer.
  - Stay in the sun as much as possible, ideally including both sunrise and
    sunset. Walk outside. Sit outside if too tired to walk.
  - Don't look at anything bright at night. Stay in complete darkness.
  - Exercise on local time, during the non-overlapping part of the day. (For
    instance, in London exercise first thing in the morning, in SF last thing
    in the evening).
  - Always eat on local time. Go hungry if necessary.

- Of course, the usual advice helps too:
  - Start adjusting ahead of time.
  - Drink lots of water.
  - Sleep for as many of your non-daylight hours as possible.
