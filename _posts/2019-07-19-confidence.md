While reading about the history of "language used to express probability"
([Sherman

[Rachel

etc) it occurs to me that perhaps it's worth analyzing text for **confidence**
in addition to sentiment. This could start with just simple word usage ("I'm
sure that", "Everyone knows") vs ("I think", "It's likely") but could maybe
develop into sophisticated phrases just like sentiment analysis has. I haven't
done any research so this may be old hat, but I wonder if it'd be illuminating
for things like analyzing social media graph relationships and how information
(including eg fake news) spreads.
