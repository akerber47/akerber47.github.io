While reading about the history of "language used to express probability"
(Sherman Kent, Rachel Kesselman, etc) it occurs to me that perhaps it's worth
analyzing text for **confidence** in addition to sentiment. This could start
with just simple word usage ("I'm sure that", "Everyone knows") vs ("I think",
"It's likely") but could maybe develop into sophisticated phrases just like
sentiment analysis has. I haven't done any research so this may be old hat, but
I wonder if it'd be illuminating for things like analyzing social media graph
relationships and how information (including eg fake news) spreads.
