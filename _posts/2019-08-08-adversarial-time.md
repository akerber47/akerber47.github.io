I learned some basics today about adversarial training for image recognition
models. I think it's interesting how these techniques are so generic
(basically, attacking the model by introspecting its structure and/or searching
its detailed output), but there hasn't as far as I know been much discussion of
these techniques in other domains. Of course, the whole concept of adversarial
examples and adversarial testing is very new, but as someone who's particularly
interested in time series modeling, I'd be curious to try and see what applies
in that domain. Time series is just an example; we could of course study
similar situations with any complex, high-capacity-high-variance model. I bet
something interesting could come out of this!
