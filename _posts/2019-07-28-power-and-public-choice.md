I just learned about a subfield of economics called Public Choice Theory.
Apparently it tries to explain how governments and bureaucracies work as
distinct from competitive markets. I wonder to what extent they consider the
role of **power** as a currency within these institutions. Monetary utility is
I suspect not always the best way to consider interactions and transactions
within a firm, especially when people's basic needs are already addressed.
(This is generally the case for almost all decision-makers of importance within
a large bureaucratic body, as far as I know.) Such an analysis would likely
extend to large private corporations as well, especially those with substantial
monopoly power.
