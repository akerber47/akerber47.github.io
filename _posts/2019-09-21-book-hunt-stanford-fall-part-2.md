Physics

Honors Intro sequence:
- Morin and/or Kelppner/Kolnikov (Mechanics)
- Purcell (E+M)

Upper div UG:
- Goldstein, Landau (!!)
- Goldstein is really good but too hard (for now)
- Relativity: Carroll
- Stat Mech: Kittel-Kroener (a bit more organized but OLD) or Reif

Sanjoy Mahajan, The Art of Insight in Science and Engineering
- really good book! "think like a physicist"

Econ

Econ 1 intro
- prof's book (Taylor)
- high school stuff

Econ 50 intermediate micro
Varian, Intermediate Micro with Calculus
- really clear and good!

Econ 52 intermediate macro
Jones, Macroeconomics
- ok, but a bit high school ish

Econ 202 micro for non econ grads
(what do the PhD students get?)
- Jehlo or Kreps or Mas-Colell

lots of boring 200 courses

Econ 270 Econometrics
- just Casella-Berger (lol)

Econ 286 Game Theroy
- Fidenberg-Tirole and Fidenberg-Levine or Osborne-Rubinstein or Topkis

Stanford Business/Finance:

UG not many core courses

Bus Acct 213 Accounting
- Hanlon et al Financial Accounting (shrink wrapped, looks crappy)

Bus Fin 201 Finance
- Berk et al, Corporate Finance (similary)
- can try library for these!

Only real business school class is 620 Financial Markets
(there's also some econ overlapping classes but just look in Econ dept)

- Campbell, Financial Decisions and Markets
- Campbell + Viceira, Strategic Asset Allocation
- Cochrane, Asset Pricing
- all very good!!
- Campbell is a bit more basic methods + empirical
- Chochrane is a bit more theoretical (perfect info/rationality)
and includes some option pricing
- buy all 3 eventually (next year) especially 1st Campbell book!

Campbell UG advice: basic microeconomics (Varian, etc), corporate finance (terminology /
"domain knowledge", and statistics is sufficient)
- MIT 18.600 => 18.650 is definitely enough!

Extra books for this class also:
- Buck, Asset Pricing and Portfolio Choice Theory
- goo! more advanced with lots of math, dynamics, stochastic calculus, etc, save for later
- Campbell-Lo-Meckinley, Econometrics of Financial Markets
- new campbell book says this one's out of date (lol)
- Gulliver, Economics of Risk and Time
- very cool! special game theory ish topics
- again, save for later

B School other subject books:

BUS 603, Casella-Berger for stats/econometrics (other books bad)
BUS 675 Mas-Collel for microecon
BUS 600 Kreps, Microeconomic Foundations
- this book mentions notes of Kim Border (Caltech) and says is "deeper and less broad"
- I think point is most people at b school at stanford already did Mas-Colell in undegrad,
so this book dives deeper on some details.
