Hi! I'm Alvin Kerber. I do math and computer things.

You can reach me at A@AB.net, where A = alvin and B = kerber. I am also on
LinkedIn, but I prefer to communicate via email.

You may be interested in my resume or github.

I try to limit my publically visible online activity, so there isn't much here.
But I do use a few social networks.  If you know me personally, go ahead and
hunt me down.  It won't be hard.
