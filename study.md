# Study Plans

I really like making plans for things to study. Sometimes I even finish!

To clarify the difference between this and the reading list:
- *reading* is me going through a book and (hopefully) remembering some
  content.
- *studying* is me actively putting effort into long term recall. This usually
  means homework exercises and exams, but can also be oral exams and presentations, spaced repetition, etc.

### CS
- Skeina, Algorithm Design Manual

followed by

- MIT OCW 6.006 => 6.046
- Cormen et al, Introduction to Algorithms

## Historical / Completed

### 2018

I bought a bunch of books but didn't get through most of them.

Skimmed:
- AI (Russell--Norvig)
- ML (Murphy, Hastie et al)
- Statistics (Rice, Ch 9-12)

And a brief, aborted stab at Knuth's Art of Computer Programming (hah!).

### 2017

Mid-2017 is when I finished my PhD in pure math. Before then all my studying
energy went into getting that done. But afterwards I did get through some things.

- Probability (MIT OCW 6.041)
- Statistics (DeGroot--Schervish, Ch 6-8)
- CS and Finance interview prep (Gayle, Crack)
