title: Alvin Kerber -- Study Tracking

# Study Tracking

I really like making plans for things to study. Sometimes I even finish!

To clarify the difference between this and the reading list:
- *reading* is me going through a book and (hopefully) remembering some
  content.
- *studying* is me actively putting effort into long term recall. This usually
  means homework exercises and exams, but can also be oral exams and presentations, spaced repetition, etc.

# Planned

### CS
- C compiler
  - Dragon book
  - Engineering a Compiler book
- Computer Networks
  - Brown CS 168
- Monte Carlo simulations
- Physics simulations

### Math
- "Honors" mathematical statistics
  - MIT 18.650
  - CMU 36-705
  - Stanford Stats 200
- Applied statistics
  - CMU 36-707
  - Stanford Stats 203
- Stochastic processes / "honors" discrete math
  - Mitzenmacher & Upfal
- Statistical / "honors" ML
- Information theory
- Differential equations
- Fourier analysis

### Finance
- Investing
  - Bodie, Kane, and Marcus
- Some kind of practical quant finance / advanced investing
  - Programming projects (do it myself!)
  - Lopez de Prado
  - Trading systems books

### 2018

I bought a bunch of books but didn't get through most of them. Nothing
organized completed this year.

Supplemental books:
- Russell & Norvig, Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach
- Murphy, Machine Learning: a Probabilistic Perspective
- Hastie et al, The Elements of Statistical Learning
- Hastie et al, Introduction to Statistical Learning
- Rice, Mathematical Statistics and Data Analysis

And a brief, aborted stab at Knuth's Art of Computer Programming (hah!).

*This is around when I realized it's much harder to study while
working full-time and not actively required to. This list is one way to
start fixing things...*

### 2017

Mid-2017 is when I finished my PhD in pure math. Before then all my studying
energy went into getting that done. But afterwards I did get through some things
while preparing to find a job.

- Probability (MIT 6.041 Applied Probability)
- Statistics (DeGroot & Schervish, Ch 6-8)
- ML (Hastie et al, Ch 1-3)
- CS and Finance interview prep (Gayle, Crack)

## Abandoned

### 2020

MIT 15.433 Investments
- This course is too easy for the material. Lots of multiple choice and
  simplistic questions. Not enough hard stuff. Not enough programming.

### 2019

MIT 14.02 Principles of Macroeconomics
- This material is not valuable for my needs. Wrong path for success.

Skeina, Algorithm Design Manual
- Ch 1 complete (2019-08-03)
- The exercises in this book are not exciting enough.
- Better for me: Cormen, MIT, Knuth, Leetcode

## Goals (2019)

This is to track ongoing personal goals. At some point I should add some
historical goals here too.

## Practices (see [Results vs Practices](2019/08/03/results-vs-practices.html)

- [No internet](2019/07/22/no-internet.html) -- **4 weeks** (since 2019-07-20).
  *(Previous record: about 70 days).*
- Writing 3x / week, at least 5 minutes each time -- **just started** (since
  2019-08-17).
- Home study 2x / week, at least 1 hour each time -- **4 weeks** (since
  2019-07-20).
- Math/CS eclectic reading 3x/week, at least 15 minutes each time -- **2
  weeks** (since 2019-08-03).
