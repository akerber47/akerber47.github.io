title: Alvin Kerber -- Goals and Study Plans
---

# Goals

This is to track ongoing personal goals. At some point I should add some
historical goals here too.

# Practices (see [Results vs Practices](2019/08/03/results-vs-practices.html)

- [No internet](2019/07/22/no-internet.html) -- **2 weeks** (since 2019-07-20).
  *(Previous record: about 70 days).*
- Writing 3x / week, at least 5 minutes each time -- **3 weeks** (since
  2019-07-13).
- Home study 2x / week, at least 1 hour each time -- **2 weeks** (since
  2019-07-20)
- Math/CS eclectic reading 3x/week, at least 15 minutes each time -- **just
  started.*

# Study Plans

I really like making plans for things to study. Sometimes I even finish!

To clarify the difference between this and the reading list:
- *reading* is me going through a book and (hopefully) remembering some
  content.
- *studying* is me actively putting effort into long term recall. This usually
  means homework exercises and exams, but can also be oral exams and presentations, spaced repetition, etc.

### CS
- Skeina, Algorithm Design Manual

followed by

- MIT OCW 6.006 => 6.046
- Cormen et al, Introduction to Algorithms

## Historical / Completed

### 2018

I bought a bunch of books but didn't get through most of them.

Skimmed:
- AI (Russell--Norvig)
- ML (Murphy, Hastie et al)
- Statistics (Rice, Ch 9-12)

And a brief, aborted stab at Knuth's Art of Computer Programming (hah!).

*This is around when I realized it's much harder to study while
working full-time and not actively required to. This list is one way to
start fixing things...*

### 2017

Mid-2017 is when I finished my PhD in pure math. Before then all my studying
energy went into getting that done. But afterwards I did get through some things.

- Probability (MIT OCW 6.041)
- Statistics (DeGroot--Schervish, Ch 6-8)
- CS and Finance interview prep (Gayle, Crack)
