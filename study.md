title: Alvin Kerber -- Study Tracking

# Study Tracking

I really like making plans for things to study. Sometimes I even finish!

To clarify the difference between this and the reading list:
- *reading* is me going through a book and (hopefully) remembering some
  content.
- *studying* is me actively putting effort into long term recall. This usually
  means homework exercises and exams, but can also be oral exams and presentations, spaced repetition, etc.

*This is around when I realized it's much harder to study while
working full-time and not actively required to. This list is one way to
start fixing things...*

### 2017

Mid-2017 is when I finished my PhD in pure math. Before then all my studying
energy went into getting that done. But afterwards I did get through some things
while preparing to find a job.

- MIT 6.041 Applied Probability
- Statistics (DeGroot & Schervish, Ch 6-8)
- ML (Hastie et al, Ch 1-3)
- CS and Finance interview prep (Gayle, Crack)

## Abandoned

### 2021

MIT 18.S096
- Similar problems as the course below. More treatment of statistical topics,
  but it's mostly from the econometric point of view. I think practically
  this will be covered better and more thoroughly with CMU 36-467/667.

MIT 15.450
- Wrong kind of quant! Heavy on derivative pricing, theoretical models, and the
  wrong sort of fancy math (stochastic calculus, probability measures, etc).

Brown CS 155
- Material covered better in dedicated courses (stochastic processes,
  information theory, statistics).

Brown CS 168
- Too many support code dependencies. Some out of date focus. Try a
  different school (yes, I know).

### 2020

MIT 15.433 Investments
- This course is too easy for the material. Lots of multiple choice and
  simplistic questions. Not enough hard stuff.

### 2019

MIT 14.02 Principles of Macroeconomics
- This material is not valuable for my plans. Wrong path for success.

Skeina, Algorithm Design Manual
- The exercises in this book are not interesting enough.
- Better for me: Cormen, MIT, Knuth, Leetcode

## Goals (2019)

This is to track ongoing personal goals. At some point I should add some
historical goals here too.

## Practices (see [Results vs Practices](2019/08/03/results-vs-practices.html)

- [No internet](2019/07/22/no-internet.html) -- **4 weeks** (since 2019-07-20).
  *(Previous record: about 70 days).*
- Writing 3x / week, at least 5 minutes each time -- **just started** (since
  2019-08-17).
- Home study 2x / week, at least 1 hour each time -- **4 weeks** (since
  2019-07-20).
- Math/CS eclectic reading 3x/week, at least 15 minutes each time -- **2
  weeks** (since 2019-08-03).
