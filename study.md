title: Alvin Kerber -- Goals and Study Plans
---

# Goals

This is to track ongoing personal goals. At some point I should add some
historical goals here too.

# Practices (see [Results vs Practices](2019/08/03/results-vs-practices.html)

- [No internet](2019/07/22/no-internet.html) -- **4 weeks** (since 2019-07-20).
  *(Previous record: about 70 days).*
- Writing 3x / week, at least 5 minutes each time -- **just started** (since
  2019-08-17).
- Home study 2x / week, at least 1 hour each time -- **4 weeks** (since
  2019-07-20).
- Math/CS eclectic reading 3x/week, at least 15 minutes each time -- **2
  weeks** (since 2019-08-03).

# Study Plans

I really like making plans for things to study. Sometimes I even finish!

To clarify the difference between this and the reading list:
- *reading* is me going through a book and (hopefully) remembering some
  content.
- *studying* is me actively putting effort into long term recall. This usually
  means homework exercises and exams, but can also be oral exams and presentations, spaced repetition, etc.

### CS
- iOS projects
- Rust projects
- Cormen et al, Introduction to Algorithms
  - MIT 6.006 => 6.046

### Math
- Rice, Mathematical Statistics and Data Analysis
  - MIT 18.650

### Finance
- Investing
  - Bodie, Kane, and Marcus
  - Dale Rosenthal (UIUC) slides
- Some kind of practical quant finance / advanced investing
  - Programming projects (do it myself!)
  - Narang
  - Lopez de Prado
  - Dale Rosenthal (UIUC) execution course slides
  - Watch out for academic books about *modeling* (eg Campbell, Cochrane)

## Historical / Completed

### 2020
- MIT 15.501 Introduction to Financial and Managerial Accounting

### 2019
- MIT 14.01 Principles of Microeconomics
- MIT 18.600 Probability and Random Variables

- C++ programming practice
  - some Leetcode questions
  - some C++ books including:
    - Effective C++
    - Effective STL
    - Effective Modern C++
    - A Tour of C++

### 2018

I bought a bunch of books but didn't get through most of them.

Skimmed:
- AI (Russell--Norvig)
- ML (Murphy, Hastie et al)
- Statistics (Rice, Ch 9-12)

And a brief, aborted stab at Knuth's Art of Computer Programming (hah!).

*This is around when I realized it's much harder to study while
working full-time and not actively required to. This list is one way to
start fixing things...*

### 2017

Mid-2017 is when I finished my PhD in pure math. Before then all my studying
energy went into getting that done. But afterwards I did get through some things.

- Probability (MIT OCW 6.041)
- Statistics (DeGroot--Schervish, Ch 6-8)
- CS and Finance interview prep (Gayle, Crack)

## Abandoned

### 2020

MIT 15.433 Investments
- This course is too easy for the material. Lots of multiple choice and
  simplistic questions. Not enough hard stuff. Not enough programming.

### 2019

MIT 14.02 Principles of Macroeconomics
- This material is not valuable for my needs. Wrong path for success.

Skeina, Algorithm Design Manual
- Ch 1 complete (2019-08-03)
- The exercises in this book are not exciting enough.
- Better for me: Cormen, MIT, Knuth, Leetcode
