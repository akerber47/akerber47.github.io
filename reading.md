# Reading

I read when I can. Maybe one day I'll get this more organized. Sadly I only
started this in July 2019, so lots of older content is lost. Maybe one day I'll
sit down and think hard about what I've read in the past that's valuable.

I'm not much of a critic but I'll mention if I have strong opinions about things.

### 2019 July

- Jacobson and Colon, *The 9/11 Report: A Graphic Adaptation*
- Fussell, *Class: A Guide Through the American Status System*

  Brilliant until he gets to "Class X," which doesn't exist. I encourage
  authors writing about class and society to take a hard look at any "different
  and special" class, especially if it's the class the author is in or wishes
  they were in.  Gray Tribe, Technocrats, Optimates, and G1 are all examples of
  this same phenomenon.

- [Susan Fowler's blog](https://www.susanjfowler.com/blog)

  Most famous for her Uber piece, but I particularly want to point to
  "[If Susan Can Learn Physics, So Can You](https://www.susanjfowler.com/blog/2016/8/26/from-the-fledgling-physicist-archives-if-susan-can-learn-physics-so-can-you)"
  and its companion,
  "[So You Want To Learn Physics...](https://www.susanjfowler.com/blog/2016/8/13/so-you-want-to-learn-physics)"
  --- wonderful and simple stuff. It reminded me of goals I forgot about.

### 2019 June

- The Cal Newport trilogy: *Deep Work*, *So Good They Can't Ignore You*, and
  *Digital Minimalism*
- Stroustrup, *A Tour of C++*
- Andrews et al, *Hidden Persuasion: 33 Psychological Influence Techniques in
  Advertising*
- Martin, *A Game of Thrones* (2nd read)
- Crispin, *The Hutt Gambit* and *Rebel Dawn*
