# Reading

I read when I can. Maybe one day I'll get this more organized. Sadly I only
started this in July 2019, so lots of older content is lost. Maybe one day I'll
sit down and think hard about what I've read in the past that's valuable.

I'm not much of a critic but I'll mention if I have strong opinions about things.
