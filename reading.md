# Reading

I read when I can. Maybe one day I'll get this more organized. Sadly I only
started this in July 2019, so lots of older content is lost. Maybe one day I'll
sit down and think hard about what I've read in the past that's valuable.

I'm not much of a critic but I'll mention if I have strong opinions about things.

  - Most famous for her Uber piece, but I particularly want to point to
  "[If Susan Can Learn Physics, So Can You](https://www.susanjfowler.com/blog/2016/8/26/from-the-fledgling-physicist-archives-if-susan-can-learn-physics-so-can-you)"
  and its companion,
  "[So You Want To Learn Physics...](https://www.susanjfowler.com/blog/2016/8/13/so-you-want-to-learn-physics)"
  --- wonderful and simple stuff. It reminded me of goals I forgot about.

like to come back to in the future.

# Abandoned Books

I often browse through books and end up abandoning them. Here's a list.

read these again.)
